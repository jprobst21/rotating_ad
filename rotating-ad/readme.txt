== Rotating Ad Plugin ==

Author: Josh Probst

== Description ==

Born from a need to create rotating ads for my own advertisers. This plugin allows the user to create groups of ads based on user-defined images and links. Group image size and duration of each ad are also customizable.

== Installation ==

How to install this plugin?

1. Search for "Rotating Ad" in the Add New Plugin section of your site or download it and upload it manually.
2. Install and activate the plugin.
3. Create groups of ads in Settings->Rotating Ad.
4. Use your groups by adding the Rotating Ad widget in Appearance->Widgets


For best results, use images of the same size that fit the dimensions of the group.
